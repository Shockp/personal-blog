# Common Design Patterns: Building Robust Software Architecture

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design. They represent best practices refined by experienced developers over decades. Understanding these patterns isn't about memorizing code—it's about recognizing problems and applying time-tested solutions.

## Why Design Patterns Matter

Patterns provide a shared vocabulary among developers. When you mention "Factory Pattern," experienced developers immediately understand the structure and intent. This common language accelerates communication and reduces misunderstandings in team environments.

More importantly, patterns encapsulate design principles like loose coupling, high cohesion, and separation of concerns. They guide us toward maintainable, extensible code that stands the test of time.

## Essential Patterns Every Developer Should Know

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton ensures a class has only one instance while providing global access to it. Think database connections, logging services, or configuration managers—resources where multiple instances would be wasteful or problematic.

```java
public class DatabaseConnection {
    private static volatile DatabaseConnection instance;

    private DatabaseConnection() {}

    public static DatabaseConnection getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (DatabaseConnection.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new DatabaseConnection();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

**When to use**: Resource-heavy objects, shared state management, or when you need exactly one instance coordinating actions across the system.

### Factory Pattern

Factories create objects without specifying their exact classes. This pattern shines when object creation logic is complex or when you need to decouple object creation from usage.

```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
}

public class PaymentFactory {
    public static PaymentProcessor createProcessor(String type) {
        return switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
            case "credit" -> new CreditCardProcessor();
            case "paypal" -> new PayPalProcessor();
            case "crypto" -> new CryptoProcessor();
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown payment type");
        };
    }
}
```

**When to use**: Complex object creation, multiple implementations of an interface, or when creation logic might change frequently.

### Observer Pattern

Observer defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all dependents are notified automatically. This pattern is fundamental to event-driven architectures and reactive programming.

```java
public interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public class NewsAgency {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String news) {
        observers.forEach(observer -> observer.update(news));
    }
}
```

**When to use**: Event systems, model-view architectures, or any scenario where changes in one object should trigger actions in multiple other objects.

### Strategy Pattern

Strategy defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern promotes composition over inheritance and enables runtime algorithm selection.

```java
public interface SortingStrategy {
    void sort(int[] array);
}

public class SortContext {
    private SortingStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(SortingStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void executeSort(int[] array) {
        strategy.sort(array);
    }
}
```

**When to use**: Multiple ways to perform a task, algorithm selection at runtime, or when you want to avoid conditional statements for choosing behavior.

## Choosing the Right Pattern

Patterns aren't silver bullets. Each solves specific problems and introduces trade-offs. Singleton can create hidden dependencies and testing challenges. Factory adds abstraction layers that might be overkill for simple scenarios. Observer can lead to memory leaks if not properly managed.

The key is recognizing the problem first, then selecting the appropriate pattern. Don't force patterns where they don't belong—simple problems often need simple solutions.

## Beyond the Basics

These four patterns form a solid foundation, but the pattern catalog is vast. Command, Decorator, Adapter, and Template Method patterns each address different architectural challenges. As you encounter new problems, research existing patterns before inventing solutions from scratch.

Remember: patterns are tools, not rules. They guide good design but shouldn't constrain creativity. The best developers know when to apply patterns and, equally important, when to break from them.

## Moving Forward

Start incorporating these patterns gradually. Recognize opportunities in your current codebase where patterns could improve design. Practice implementing them in small projects before applying them to production systems.

Design patterns represent decades of collective wisdom. By understanding and applying them thoughtfully, you're building on the shoulders of giants, creating software that's not just functional, but elegant and maintainable.

**Content Flow:**
Visitors land on the homepage and can immediately see recent blog posts. They can navigate to the full blog listing or read individual posts. The about page provides context about the author and their expertise.

**Content Management Flow:**
Blog posts are created as Markdown files with frontmatter metadata. Content is statically generated at build time for optimal performance.
